# Mesh-Processing
  
  The project is based on Olga Sorkine's state-of-art paper on Laplacian Mesh Processing.
  Combinatorial, distance and cotangent weights based Laplacian operator is created for
  a mesh. Eigen decomposition for mesh processing and water-marking is performed.
  
  The project was created using QT creator, C++, Eigen and OpenGL
